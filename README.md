# The Long Cross Delta

I am very much a beginner at antenna modeling.  I know just enough to be dangerous.  This repository holds a description of something interesting I cooked up while playing with delta-loop antennas.

For reasonable heights, this antenna has massive gain at 5 degrees the horizon -- like 7 to 10 db over a ground-mounted vertical.  I'm highly suspicious that I am doing something incorrect, so I thought I throw together a quick description so others could critique.

The best place to start looking is [The short presentation I made] (https://github.com/robdmc/longcross_delta/blob/main/description.pdf)
